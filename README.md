## About Dataset
- **Dataset Link:** [Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itshaseebsaeed/bitcoin-mempool-state-data)
- **Context:** Satoshi Nakamoto created something called Bitcoin in 2009. This implements Blockchain technology. Blockchain is like a public ledger that keeps track of all of its transactions.
- **Usage:** This dataset provides information about blockchain blocks and transactions during a specific block height. It includes logs from entering and leaving the mempool, named 'Log_In.json' and 'Log_out.json'.
- **Interesting Fact:** This dataset captures a significant phase in Bitcoin's history, as its value surged from $19,400 to an astonishing $57,500!

## Method & Acknowledgements
- This dataset is derived from Nodes maintained by the 'Blockchain lab' at SEECS, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST).
- Special thanks to Dr. Taha Ali (Assistant Professor) for his support.

## Inspiration
- **Question:** How long would it take for the transaction to get accepted?
- **Factors:** Transaction Size, Transaction Priority, Transaction Ancestor Count, Transaction Ancestor Size, Transaction Amount, Transaction Latency, Mempool Size Growth Rate, Mempool Size, Incoming Transaction Rate, Mempool Transaction Count, Seconds Since Last Block, Reward Fees, Block Size, Blocks To Confirm, Mining Poolâ€™s Profitability, Bitcoin Price.

Feel free to explore and analyze this dataset to uncover insights into blockchain transactions and the fascinating world of cryptocurrencies.
